## Installation
    
Start by typing in "npm i" to install the necessary dependencies(fs and inquirer). Then orient your terminal to the parent folder of index.js and run the program by typing in "node index" or "node index.js".
    
    
## Usage
    
Once the program is run, the terminal will prompt the user with a series of questions about the project. Once all these questions are answered, the program will exit and output a README.md file in the OPENME folder. This application does not have an option to drop images into the README(I found it easier to drop the pictures in there after the readme is generated), but I hope to implement a way to include such functionality without it being so tedious.
    
    
## Credits
    
I'd like to thank my instructors, and my co-learners.
